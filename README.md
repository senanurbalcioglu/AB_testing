### BUSINESS PROBLEM
Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, "average bidding", as an alternative to the existing bidding type called "maximumbidding". One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and would like to do an A/B test to see if averagebidding increase interaction effect.
A/B testing has been going on for 1 month and bombabomba.com is now asking you to do this. It is waiting for you to analyze the results of the A/B test.
The success criterion for Bombambomba.com is Purchase. Therefore, the focus should be on the Purchase metric for statistical testing.
